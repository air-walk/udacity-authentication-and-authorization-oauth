# Udacity - Authentication & Authorization: OAuth
This repo contains solved exercises for Udacity's [Authentication & Authorization: OAuth](https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330) course (and also serves as a reminder that I have taken this course). For a 
full blown implementation of a project that uses OAuth for authentication and authorization, checkout [my other repository](https://github.com/air-walk/udacity-item-catalog-app).
